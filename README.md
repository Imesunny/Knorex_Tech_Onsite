# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Weather Component

This is a simple React component that fetches and displays weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to select a city from a dropdown menu and view the current weather as well as the forecast for the next three days.

## Features

- Fetches current weather data and forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the selected city.
- Displays the current weather information including temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed.
- Shows the forecast for the next three days with temperature and description.
- Handles loading and error state gracefully.

## Usage

To use this component, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or copy the component code into your React project.
2. Make sure you have React installed in your project.
3. Replace the `apiKey` variable with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
4. Import and use the `WeatherComponent` in your React application.
5. The component will automatically fetch weather data when a city is selected.
